          <h2>SABER</h2>
          <p>
            SABER stands for Sounding of the atmosphere using Broadband Emission
            Radiometry. SABER instrument is one of four instruments on NASA’s
            TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetic Dynamics)
            satellite. The primary goal of the SABER experiment is to provide
            the data needed to advance our understanding of fundamental
            processes governing the energetic, chemistry, dynamics, and
            transport in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. SABER
            accomplishes this with global measurements of the atmosphere using a
            10-channel broadband limb-scanning infrared radiometer covering the
            spectral range from 1.27 µm to 17 µm.

          <h2>MODIS</h2>
          <p>
            MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) is a key
            instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua
            (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites. Terra's orbit around the
            Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the
            equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the
            equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the
            entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36
            spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths. These data will improve
            our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the
            land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a
            vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive
            Earth system models

          <h2>TOMS</h2>
          <p>
            Its name stands for Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. It was
            launched on 02 July 1996.TOMS measure the ozone in atmosphere and it
            also measure sulfur dioxide released in volcanic eruptions. The toms
            is a satellite instrument for measuring ozone values. It has been
            flown on NASA- satellites. Of the five TOMS instruments which were
            built , four entered successful orbit. Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3
            provided global measurements of total column ozone on a daily basis
            and together provide a complete data set of daily ozone from
            November 1978 to December 1994. After an eighteen-month period when
            the program had no on-orbit capability, ADEOS TOMS was launched on
            august 17,1996 and provided data until satellite which housed it
            lost power on June 29, 1997

          <h2>CALIPSO</h2>
          <p>
            The CALIPSO satellite provides new insight into the role that clouds
            and atmospheric aerosols play in regulating Earths’ weather,
            climate, and air quality. CALIPSO combines an active LIDAR
            instrument with passive infrared and visible imagers to probe the
            vertical structure and properties of thin clouds and aerosols over
            the globe. CALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006, with the cloud
            sat satellite. CALIPSO and Cloud sat are highly complementary and
            together provide new, never- before-seen 3D perspectives of how
            clouds and aerosols form, evolve, and affect weather and climate.
            CALIPSO and cloud Sat fly in formation with three other satellites
            in the A- train constellation to enable an even greater
            understanding of our climate system.
